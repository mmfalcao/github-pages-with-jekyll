<h2 align="center"> What the James Webb Space Telescope’s first images tell us about the universe </h2>


NASA unveiled full-color images from the $11 billion James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on Tuesday, marking the first of what is sure to be many releases from the super powerful optical instrument. But even taken by themselves, these five images mark a massive achievement and the culmination of a 26-year-long process to give humanity an even more detailed look into the early universe.

The image reveal today followed the initial image release by President Joe Biden on Monday. That shot, named “Webb’s First Deep Field,” showed the cluster SMACS 0723, a vast swirl of galaxies that in actuality only represents a slice of the universe the size of “a grain of sand on the tip of your finger at arm’s length,” as NASA Administrator Bill Nelson put it on the livestream.

Today’s revelations include a galactic cluster and a black hole; the atmosphere of a distant planet; a distant star’s epic death knell; and a “stellar nursery” where stars are born. We’ve gotten a look at some of these targets before, thanks to JWST’s predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, and all of them were known to astronomers. But due to the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST’s instruments and its capacity to view objects in the infrared spectrum, we’re able to see these galactic forms with more clarity than ever before.
